# S1

S1 is an audio plugin synthesizer built with [JUCE Framework](https://juce.com).

At the moment it works only on Mac OSX.

It was born from my desire to delve deeper into audio software development and represents the beginning of my journey

## Develop

In order to work on it, you must have Juce installed in your computer.

Once you have it correctly installed, just double-click on S1.jucer, and you should be able to work on it.

N.B. S1 is still a WIP project (and maybe it will be forever, always expanding with more and more features) and it represents my journey in the audio development world.
